hi,this is my neuralnetwork and deeplearning project.To get a practical knowledge about the models ,I have done this.Here i used bert model to detect toxicity  in a comment.
BERT language model is an open source machine learning framework for natural language processing (NLP).
BERT is designed to help computers understand the meaning of ambiguous language in text by using surrounding text to establish context. 
The BERT framework was pretrained using text from Wikipedia and can be fine-tuned with question-and-answer data sets.
BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is based on transformers,
a deep learning model in which every output element is connected to every input element, and the weightings between them are dynamically calculated based upon their connection.
